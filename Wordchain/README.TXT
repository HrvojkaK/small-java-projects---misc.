Word chain game, using spanish words. 

Program asks the player for a spanish word, then responds with a new one, which starts with the last two letters of the previous one.
Player must then enter a new word, starting with the last two letters of the previous one...
A word can be used only once.

(Spanish words are taken from the 'spanish.txt' file which contains words with more than 3 letters - 
game limitation: if a player enters a valid spanish word that isn't contained in this file, program will tell
the player that the word entered is not in the dictionary, and the player lost.)
