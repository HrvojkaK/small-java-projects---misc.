Hangman game.

Draws a random word from an English or German dictionary ("engl.txt" file or "germ.txt") and lets you guess. German dictionary doesn't contain any words with special German letters!

You can guess a single letter - if the word contains it, it will be displayed; if not, another part of the hanged man is drawn (you lose when the drawing is completed).
You can also guess the whole word, but if you guess wrong you lose immediately.
